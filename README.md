# About me 👋

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a Full Stack Web Developer, and I don't only enjoy it, but love it. It has become an addiction 😎

For you to **know a bit more about me**:

- 🔭 I’m a Lab Technician 🥼🦠🔬 apart from being Full Stack Web Developer 💻
- 🌱 Always learning something new about a program language (I know, HTML and CSS are not programming languages 😁), and in my free time, to dance Salsa and Bachata 💃
- 💬 Ask me about whatever you prefer, but better if I know the answer 😜
- 📫 How to reach me: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicia-benavente-garcia)
- 👀 Curiosity about me: 🏋️‍♀️ gym y 🧖‍♀️ ñam 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't consider myself a freak, but I've seen Star Wars movies at least ten times each

If you want to know more about me, you already know how to contact!

PS: I want to share this project I've been developing along with Marcos Estevez and David Alonso, because we are so excited about implementing it!
